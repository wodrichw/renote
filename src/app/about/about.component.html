          <h3>Purpose of Renote</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article-body">
          <p>
            When it comes to effectiveness, there is no comparison to handwritten notes. Many well established <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away"
              target="_blank">articles</a> state this to be true. Handwriting notes as opposed to typing them increases creativity,
            and retention of what is being scribed. However, in an electronic age, it is becoming more difficult to exclusively
            use pen and paper. This what sparked the idea for Renote.
            <br>
            <br> Renote is a webapp that can convert your notes on pen and paper to electronic text.

          <h3>How to Use Renote</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article-body">
          <p>
            To use Renote, you must first create a Renote account. Once you login, you are able to upload an image (as a jpeg) of your
            handwritten notes. Renote will then take your image and process it into text. From there, you will have a text
            file that contains the text from you notes on pen and paper. You have several options for storing your text file.
            You can store it on your Renote account, download the file, or upload that file to your Google Drive. You can
            additionally create folders on your Renote account to store your text files in so that you can stay more organized.

          <h3>How Renote Works</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="article-body">
          <p>
            Renote is able to convert an image of handwriting to electronic text through a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"
              target="_blank">optical character recognition</a> (OCR). OCR looks at an image of a letter, and guesses what
            character it is looking at. This is a difficult thing for computers to do. So to help guess what letters it is
            looking at, Renote also uses something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"
              target="_blank">neuronet</a>. A neuronet is a type of machine learning algorithm that is based off how neurons
            interact with each other in a brain. It allows Renote to learn from the previous data it has looked at. This
            means that Renote will become more accurate over time.

            <h3>Renote is Build with Angular and Firebase</h3>
          </div>
          <div class="article-body">
            <p>
              <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">Angular</a> is a javascript framework that is created by
              Google. The cool feature of Angular, is it allows for 2-way data binding. This means that Angular will detect
              when there is changes in java script files and automatically update the DOM. This makes developing in Angular
              very simple for DOM interactions.
              <br>
              <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase">Firebase</a> is a database service that updates in real
              time. Firebase provides an API for Angular that allows all cloud data to be synchronized for all clients accessing
              Renote.
              <br>
              <br> Angular and Firebase together form a beautiful symbiotic relationship. The Angular 2-way data binding
              automatically updates the DOM when there are updates in the module and vice versa. Combine this with the Firebase
              API that listens for updates in the Angular module and automatically updates the database, and you get a sort
              of 3-way data binding. Meaning that whenever there is an update in either the DOM, Angular module, or the Firebase
              database, the other two will automatically be updated as well.
              <br>
              <br> Letâ€™s look at how this benefits Renote. Say you just took a picture of your notes converted it to text
              with Renote on your phone. You then store that text file in a folder on your Renote account. If you also were
              logged into Renote on you laptop, you would instantly see the added file from your phone, without having to
              refresh your browser.
