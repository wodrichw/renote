                <p>
                  When it comes to effectiveness, there is no comparison to handwritten notes. Many well established <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/17/474525392/attention-students-put-your-laptops-away"
                    target="_blank">articles</a> state this to be true. Handwriting notes as opposed to typing them increases
                  creativity, and retention of what is being scribed. However, in an electronic age, it is becoming more
                  difficult to exclusively use pen and paper. This what sparked the idea for Renote.
                  <br>
                  <br> Renote is a webapp that can convert your notes on pen and paper to electronic text.

                <p>
                  To use Renote, you must first create a Renote account. Once you login, you are able to upload an image (as a jpeg) of your
                  handwritten notes. Renote will then take your image and process it into text. From there, you will have
                  a text file that contains the text from you notes on pen and paper. You have several options for storing
                  your text file. You can store it on your Renote account, download the file, or upload that file to your
                  Google Drive. You can additionally create folders on your Renote account to store your text files in so
                  that you can stay more organized.

                <h3>How Renote Works</h3>
              </div>
              <div class="article-body">
                <p>
                  Renote is able to convert an image of handwriting to electronic text through a technology called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition"
                    target="_blank">optical character recognition</a> (OCR). OCR looks at an image of a letter, and guesses
                  what character it is looking at. This is a difficult thing for computers to do. So to help guess what letters
                  it is looking at, Renote also uses something called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network"
                    target="_blank">neuronet</a>. A neuronet is a type of machine learning algorithm that is based off how
                  neurons interact with each other in a brain. It allows Renote to learn from the previous data it has looked
                  at. This means that Renote will become more accurate over time.

                  <h3>Renote is Build with Angular and Firebase</h3>
                </div>
                <div class="article-body">
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AngularJS">Angular</a> is a javascript framework that is created
                    by Google. The cool feature of Angular, is it allows for 2-way data binding. This means that Angular
                    will detect when there is changes in java script files and automatically update the DOM. This makes developing
                    in Angular very simple for DOM interactions.
                    <br>
                    <br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firebase">Firebase</a> is a database service that updates
                    in real time. Firebase provides an API for Angular that allows all cloud data to be synchronized for
                    all clients accessing Renote.
                    <br>
                    <br> Angular and Firebase together form a beautiful symbiotic relationship. The Angular 2-way data binding
                    automatically updates the DOM when there are updates in the module and vice versa. Combine this with
                    the Firebase API that listens for updates in the Angular module and automatically updates the database,
                    and you get a sort of 3-way data binding. Meaning that whenever there is an update in either the DOM,
                    Angular module, or the Firebase database, the other two will automatically be updated as well.
                    <br>
                    <br> Letâ€™s look at how this benefits Renote. Say you just took a picture of your notes converted it to
                    text with Renote on your phone. You then store that text file in a folder on your Renote account. If
                    you also were logged into Renote on you laptop, you would instantly see the added file from your phone,
                    without having to refresh your browser.
